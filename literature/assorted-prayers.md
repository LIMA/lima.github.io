## **The Serenity Prayer**

God, grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  
Courage to change the things I can;  
and the Wisdom to know the difference  

## **Third Step Prayer, Life With Hope**

Higher Power,  
I have tried to control the uncontrollable for far too long.  
I ask that you take this burden from me.  
I acknowledge that my life is unmanageable.  
I ask for your care and guidance.  
Grant me honesty, courage, humility, and serenity, to face that which keeps me from you and others.  
I give this life to you to do with as you will.  

## **An Eleventh Step Prayer**

Higher Power,  
Please help me.  
Help me learn what I am supposed to learn,  
Help me do what I am supposed to do,  
Help me be who I am supposed to be.  
Stay with me always,  
In my hour of deepest despair,  
And my hour of greatest joy.  

## **Set Aside Prayer**

God,
Please help me set aside  
everything I think I know about myself, my disease, these steps, and especially You;  
for an open mind  
and a new experience with myself, my disease, these steps, and especially You.  

## **Closing (Unity) Prayer**

I put my hand in yours  
and together we can do  
what we could never do alone.  
No longer is there a sense of hopelessness.  
No longer must we each  
depend upon our own unsteady will power.  
We are all together now  
reaching out our hands  
for a power and strength, greater than ours.  
And, as we join hands  
we find love and understanding  
beyond our wildest dreams.
